                    <p>Hi, I’m Didhiti, a second-year Computer Science and Engineering student at SRMIST with a passion for front-end development and creating interactive, user-friendly web experiences. I enjoy blending creativity with code to build solutions that engage users and solve real-world problems. Currently, I’m expanding my skills in JavaScript frameworks and exploring new ways to enhance website functionality and design. When I'm not coding, I love working on collaborative projects and discovering ways technology can make a positive impact. Let's connect and create something amazing together!</p>
